# AbbeyWebProject
Final Project for CS234N

This CRUD application generates a code first MySQL database.
It uses a Monk model and API controller to display data about the monks on a web page.
The data can be altered, deleted, retrieved, and added to using a form.

The client side JavaScript/HTML/CSS is an altered version of an application written by my professor Mari.
